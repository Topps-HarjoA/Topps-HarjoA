<h3>Vinyl Stickers</h3>
<p>

I first created my stickers from images I found on Google and then I put them into CorelDraw. 
In CorelDraw I made the images into bitmaps and then took the steps need to prepare the picture for becoming stickers.
The steps I took to turn prepare these images was the most challenging part because I found it difficult 
to create the pink outline around which the machine would read as a cut the image to create the sticker.
Then I exported the photos into eps so that the printer could read them as sticker.
I placed the file onto a flash drive and took it to the poster printer where using special paper I printed out the stickers using RasterWork.
I created each sticker because I really liked the show Star Trek Discovery and I also love the city of Paris where I studied abroad.
From the process I learned how to make a sticker which I reall enjoyed doing even if I had difficulties creating the special file needed to make a sticker.

<h3>Decal Stickers</h3>
<p>

The decal stickers I created were based off television shows I really enjoy. 
The shows included Westworld, Deadly Class, Dear White People and Goblin (a korean drama). I also made a sticker in support of the school. 
I first made the design for the stickers from Google Images which I turned into Bitmaps. 
I transfered the designs onto a USB and then moved them to the computer connected to the machine used to make decals.
Before I could print the images I had to change the paper in the machine which was not as difficult as I thought. 
Once printed I cut out around the design then using special tools removed the excess paper. 
Then using clear transfer paper and a scaper that can be seen in the image below, I put the sticky side over the sticker to transfer the design onto the clear transfer paper.
I wanted to put the decal on my laptop so I cleaned the surface of my laptop to remove all the dust making it easier for the decal to stick.
Then I pealed away the backing of the decal and placed the stickers on my laptop. 
Oddly enough the most difficult part was transfering my decals onto the labtop because I found it really hard to get it off the clear transfer paper.
During the whole process I learned that making a decal is really simple and that I will never buy one off amazon again.

<h3>CNC Milling</h3>
	
<p>
I designed my CNC milling project using a website which would make a 2D image into a 3D model. 
With the 3D model of the Star Trek image I chose from Google I used Meshmixer to edit and fix any errors in the 3D design. 
I then sent the mold to Mr. Gerber who created the CNC Milling while I went on Spring Break. 
On the last day of class Mr. Gerber presented the class with our food grade mold created from the CNC Milling.
Using these molds we got to make chocolate which were really good.
