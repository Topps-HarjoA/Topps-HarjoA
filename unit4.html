<h1>Unit 4</h1>
<h2>Laser Cutting, Engraving and Vinyl Cutting</h2>
<br>
<p>
In Unit 4 we learned how to do computer contolled cutting on a variety of materials such as vinyl, leather and glass.

<h3>Raster Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>
In Raster Laser Cutting part of this unit I decided to test this method of cutting by lasering a design on a phone back. 
I first used CorelDraw to create a bitmap of a logo from one of my favorite Netflix shows called Black Mirror. 
I cleaned up the logo and set the line width to .75 because the logo's lines were very skinny and I wanted the design to be a raster meaning not cut through the leather phone back. 
Once my design was complete I raster cut the logo onto the phoneback after putting in the specific speed and power setting for the material and the dimensions.

<h3>Engraving</h3>
<p>
I engraved a glass jar. The first steps was creating a design on Corel Draw and I decided to copy a quote from one of my favorite poets, Maya Angelou. 
I found I nice font for the quote and then made sure they fit the dimensions of the jar which was measured by length from the circumference of the jar and the width was the height of the jar.
My design had to be rotated 270 because of the way the jar was going to be engraved. 
I transfered the design to the laser printer, and then set up the platform that was special for bottles or jars because it would spin the jar while the laser printer engraved. 
The whole process took about 10 minutes really but what I realized while engraving was that I placed my design too high on the jar so the quote apeared really high on the jar which makes the final product look a bit awkward.
In the end the final product had the engraved design on the jar, and turned out pretty cool all things considered.

<h3>Vinyl Cuttting</h3>
<p>
The assignment for Vinyl Cutting was to make a clock using a vinyl record which was really a cool experience. 
For the design of my clock I took inspiration from my favorite television shows which I placed around the clock making the clock a commemoration of great science fiction shows.
I had a lot of fun designing my clock on Corel Draw and I had to be very thoughtful in making the piece so important words from the titles would not be lost by being cut out. 
I learned to combat this effect I had to make lines in certain places and you can see below in my images of my clock such as in the O un 'zone' of Twilight Zone and 'who' in Doctor Who. 
Once I was sure I had all the pieces in my design I wanted I made a protype to test my design work and realized I could cut a lot more of my design to make the laser's job more efficient.
With full confidence in my design I laser cut the design into the vinyl and made my clock background. 
To finish off my clock I added the mechanics, the clock accessories and then when the clock was fully opporational I put my clock on the wall with Mr. Gerber.
