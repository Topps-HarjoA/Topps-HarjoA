<h3> Assignment </h3>
<p>
1. Describe your project.
My project was to create an entire outfit. I designed a two piece dress which I would sew from just pieces of fabric I found in the Maker Space.
The two pieces of fabric was a brown old fashion looking cloth and a light weight gold fabric that looks as though it could be bed sheets.
My project was also to create a leather bracelet and put an engraved design on it to go with the top and skirt. 
For the entire project I spent around 10 hours creating this dress and bracelet including all the design and production work. 
The settings and configurations I used on the sewing machine was varied based on which part of the garment I was doing relative to speed but the stitch was always on one.
For Corel Draw I turned the image into a bitmap and set it to the dimensions of the bracelet. 
I took the CorelDraw file to the laser engraver and brought over a leather bracelet in the Maker Space.
Then using the bracelt I focused the machine and then made sure the bracelet was at the top corner. 
I then proceeded to print the design after putting in the preference setting for the dimenisions and what the speed and power of laser should be for a 1/8" of leather.
From this project I learned how to make a two piece dress from just two pieces of fabric. 
Overall I really enjoyed my final project because I love designing clothes and making this from basically nothing.

<i>The first 4 images are process pictures for my two piece dress. 
The first image is my original design which I later alterned in my creation and has all my measurements.
The second image is when I made the top of my dress. The third is when the dress was half way done and coming together.
The fourth image is the final dress I created with the top complete and the high low gold skirt.
The fifth image is of the image I used to make the words on the bracelet.
The sixth image is my final bracelet.
