<i>The first 4 images are process pictures for my two piece dress. 
The first image is my original design which I later alterned in my creation and has all my measurements.
The second image is when I made the top of my dress. The third is when the dress was half way done and coming together.
The fourth image is the final dress I created with the top complete and the high low gold skirt.
The fifth image is of the image I used to make the words on the bracelet.
The sixth image is my final bracelet.
