<h1>Unit 8</h1>
<h2>Soldering and Electronics</h2>
<br>
<p>
In Unit 8 we learned about soldering and electronics by practicing soldering through two projects and learning the basics about electronics.

<h3> Blinker </h3>

<p>
The blinker was my first soldering project ever which turned out pretty good. 
Although I lost the video showing proving that it worked perfectly I guarantee that it does. 
The challenges that I faced while soldering was how to melt the solder with the soldering iron in the right place on the circuit board.
In the end I found the experience to be really fun because it was something you can really zone out doing.

<h3> Heart </h3>

<p>
I really enjoyed soldering this heart even though I found it a little difficult to solder all the LED on.
I know that I must have done something wrong during the soldering process proaby overheating the motherboard because only half the lights turned on as shown in the image below.
