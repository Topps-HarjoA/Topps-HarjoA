<h1>Unit 8</h1>
<h2>Soldering and Electronics</h2>
<br>
<p>
In Unit 8 we learned about soldering and electronics by practicing soldering through two projects and learning the basics about electronics.

<h3> Blinker </h3>

<p>
The blinker was my first soldering project ever which turned out pretty good. 
Although I lost the video showing proving that it worked perfectly I guarantee that it does. 
The challenges that I faced while soldering was how to melt the solder with the soldering iron in the right place on the circuit board.
In the end I found the experience to be really fun because it was something you can really zone out doing.

<h3> Heart </h3>

<p>
I really enjoyed soldering this heart even though I found it a little difficult to solder all the LED on.
I know that I must have done something wrong during the soldering process proaby overheating the motherboard because only half the lights turned on as shown in the image below.

<h3> Electronics </h3>
<p>
Capacitor - stores eectrical energy in an electric field
<br>
Transistor - used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
<br>
Resistor - a designed resistance to the passage of an electric current.
<br>
Led - a light-emitting diode and is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows throught it.
<br>
Diode - a semiconductor device with two terminal
<br>
Potentiometer - is a three terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.
<br>
Breadboard - is a solderless device for temporary prototype with electonics and test circuit designs.
<br>
Multimeter - is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit.
<br>
Switch - a device for making and breaking the connection in an electric circuit.
<br>
The difference between Voltage, Current and Resistance is that voltage is the difference in charge between two points. 
Current is the rate at which charge is flowing. 
Resistance is a material's tendency to resist the flow of change of charge also known as current.
<br>
The the difference between AC and DC is that the alternating current is when the direction of electricity flow is constantly reversed througout the circuit.
While a direct circuit is when electricity flows in one direction between power and ground.
