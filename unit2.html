<h1>Unit 2</h1>
<h2>CAD Fusion 360 and Design</h2>
<br>  
<p>
In Unit 2 we explored the program of Fusion 360 and learned how to create 3-D models. 
We challenged oursleves by creating 6 design on Fusion from the Pratice Drawings, 
and then had the option to create furniture, hinge, snapfit case, or labtop stand.

<h3>Laptop Stand</h3>  

<p>
The successes and failures of creating the Laptop Stand is that it took a long time to figure out
all the ins and out of Fusion 360. Even with the help of the youtube video which seemed to move 
very quickly I struggle at points. One of my major struggles was making a plane in the center of stand
in order to make supports for the labtop stand. Also I struggled with getting all the parts to fit together
right. But overall I succeeded in completed the design and even added my own personal element.
