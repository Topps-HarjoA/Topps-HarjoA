<h3>Garment Printing</h3>
<p>
When first creating a design to place on a garment you need to set the dimensions for the product and using a vector program such as CorelDraw to create a design for the garmet. 
Once completing the design I used the GTX printer program to place my design on a virtual t-shirt. 
When my design was lined up perfectly on shirt I created a file that the GTX printer could read. 
I got a blank white shirt and first ironed the front so the printer would have a flat surface to work on.
Then I placed my shirt on the printer and put in the USB which contained my design. 
I printed my design after selecting it from the USB and then the shirt went inside the printer and the ink was sprayed onto the shirt.
After the design was finished being printed on I transported the shirt back to the iron in order to dry the ink.
Overall I think the process was fairly easy to do and was pretty fast and I hope to make many more garmets in my future.
