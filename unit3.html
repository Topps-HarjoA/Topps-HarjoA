<h1>Unit 3</h1> 
<h2>Design / Garment, Sublimation and UV Printing</h2>
<br>
<p>
In Unit 3 we are challenged to place designs on different types of products using different printing methods: garment, sublimation and uv printing.

<h3>Garment Printing</h3>
<p>
When first creating a design to place on a garment you need to set the dimensions for the product and using a vector program such as CorelDraw to create a design for the garmet. 
Once completing the design I used the GTX printer program to place my design on a virtual t-shirt. 
When my design was lined up perfectly on shirt I created a file that the GTX printer could read. 
I got a blank white shirt and first ironed the front so the printer would have a flat surface to work on.
Then I placed my shirt on the printer and put in the USB which contained my design. 
I printed my design after selecting it from the USB and then the shirt went inside the printer and the ink was sprayed onto the shirt.
After the design was finished being printed on I transported the shirt back to the iron in order to dry the ink.
Overall I think the process was fairly easy to do and was pretty fast and I hope to make many more garmets in my future.

<h3>Sublimation</h3>
<p>
For sublimation printing I created a mug. I first found the dimensions for the mug using my class' database and put these dimensions into the vector program CorelDraw.
I based my design off the idea of inspiration and my heritage. The front of my design has the E.E. Cummins quote and the back is an intrigrate design of Africa.
After finalizing my design I had to mirror the image because the design is going to be placed on the mug like a tattoo.
I transfered my mirror design to the computer that was connected to the printer which had paper used especially for sublimation.
Once I printed out the design I cut it out of the paper and stuck the design paper onto the mug using special tape that could withstand high heats.
Then I used the sublimation machine for the mugs to heat the design on the paper and transfer it to the mug after being heated at an around 400 degree Farenheit for about 5 minutes.
Once complete you have to quickly take off the template while the mug is still really hot and then place the mug into a bucket of water for about a minute so it can cool off.
My finished mug I believed turned out really well and all the graphics looked really nice in my opinion.

<h3>UV Printing</h3>
<p>
With UV Printing I created a design for a popsocket which had the dimensions 1.5" x 1.5". 
I placed these dimensions into CorelDraw and thought of ideas for an interesting image.
My inspiration was to make a gift for my Korean friend who has the same birthday as me and have something that showed my love for her as well as something seen in her culture.
I have learned that this hand gesture is used to say you love someone with one hand which I thought was perfect and it was also simple.
After my design was finished I transfered the jpg of the image to the computer connected to the UV printer and using program after a few adjustment sent the design to printed. 
I first had to make sure I put the popsocket into the printer so the design could be printed on it. 
Then after I hit print the machine took a while before it actually began to place the design on the popsocket since but one it got started it only took a couple minutes.
The process was easy I just think that the program used to control the UV printer was a bit confusing.

<H3>Sublmation vs. UV</h3>
<p>
Sublimation is not better than UV printing becaue UV printing is a simplier process which takes less time and 
can be used on almost every kind of material.
