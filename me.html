<h1>About Me - Aja Topps-Harjo</h1>  
<p>
My name is Aja Topps-Harjo and I was born in Washington D.C. I am a sophmore at Western Reserve Academy. I really enjoy traveling and have lived in Los Angeles, New Zealand and France.
I really love the arts in general especially music, 3-D art, and design. I have am really interested in science, math and technology as well.
I am interested in Digital Fabrication because it include art and design which I really enjoy.
Also I believe that Digital Fabrication will bring my crafting skills to a new level by having technology involve.
Overall I really just wanted to try something new and challenge myself by combining my two passions of STEM and art.
