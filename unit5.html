<h1>Unit 5</h1>
<h2>3-D Printing and Scanning</h2>
<br>
<p>
In this unit we learned how to 3-D scan people and 3-D printing using Fusion 360 and Meshmix for design and Makerbot to print.

<h3>Unit Reflection Questions</h3>
<p>
1. The 3D printing process that MakerBot Replicator uses is Fused Desposition Modeling (FDM) 
which is the additive manufacturing process in which plastic filament is heated and fed through 
an extruder to build your object layer by layer. The advantages of the FDM is that it is most widely used 
because it is perfect for consumers and great for making protypes. The FDM has the lowest resolution and 
accuracy when compared to SLA or SLS and is not the best option for printing complex designs or parts with intricate features.

2. Combine two 3D print files using Meshmixer.
You will need to scan your face and attach it to a pedastal base. 
The overall print should not be more than 4 inches tall. 
Print out the final file and make sure you document the process. 
Include all files and the final file. For help on Meshmixer use these videos .

3. Design and print small 3D object that could not be made subtractively.

4.With a partner or alone, create something useful using additive manufacturing. 
You will need to 3D print your useful object and the file must be your own creation. 
Some examples of useful objects can be found Useful 3D printed objects and here .
