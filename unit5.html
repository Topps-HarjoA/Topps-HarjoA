<h1>Unit 5</h1>
<h2>3-D Printing and Scanning</h2>
<br>
<p>
In this unit we learned how to 3-D scan people and 3-D printing using Fusion 360 and Meshmix for design and Makerbot to print.

<h3>Rules and Limits of Makerbot</h3>
<p>
1. The 3D printing process that MakerBot Replicator uses is Fused Desposition Modeling (FDM) 
which is the additive manufacturing process in which plastic filament is heated and fed through 
an extruder to build your object layer by layer. The advantages of the FDM is that it is most widely used 
because it is perfect for consumers and great for making protypes. The FDM has the lowest resolution and 
accuracy when compared to SLA or SLS and is not the best option for printing complex designs or parts with intricate features.

<h3> Meshmix two objects </h3>

<i>This is an image of the my 3D model of myself, the pedestal for my head and lastly the combination of the two in the final product. </i>
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="aja.stl"> 3d Scan of Me .stl format.</a> </li>
<li><a href="pedestal.stl"> Pedestal .stl format.</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
In order to mesh the two 3D items together I first fixed up my 3D scan then made sure to do a plane cut in order to easily add the two models together.
Then I selected both of the objects and merged them together. I then added a few touches to my face just to explore all the capacities of Meshmixe.
</p>

3. Design and print small 3D object that could not be made subtractively.

4.With a partner or alone, create something useful using additive manufacturing. 
You will need to 3D print your useful object and the file must be your own creation. 
Some examples of useful objects can be found Useful 3D printed objects and here .
