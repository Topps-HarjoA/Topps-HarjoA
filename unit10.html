In Unit 10 we learned how to sew and applied these skills to producing a pair of pajama pants.

<h3> Pants </h3>

<p>
I first started the process of making the pajama pants by choosing my fabic which are Zelda themed. 
After selecting the fabric I cut out the pieces of fabric in the shape I needed to make the pants.
I first created my belt for the pants by ironing a long piece of fabric to resemble a string to put along the waist band then sew it shut.
The next part was starting to make the actual pants which I began by pinning each leg of the pants together from the bottom.
I then sewed the legs and then went to the iron where I flattened the seam.
Next I worked on sowing the crotch together after I pinned the crotch together. 
Once I sewed the crotch I worked to create the hem for the pants. 
In order to know te measurements for the hem I put on the pants and someone helped pin the hem for me.
After getting the measurement I evenly created a hem on both legs and pinned the hem in preparation of the sewing machine.
Making these leg hems were one of the most time consuming parts of creating these pants.
After sewing up the pant's hems I went to make the waist part for the belt.
I finished making the belt hole I encountered the most challenging part of the process which was feeding my belt through the hold because it did not work the first couple times so I ended up taking apart the pants a couple of times in order for the belt to fit.
Eventually I got the belt through the pant's waist and finished my pants.
In the end, I did not learn anything about a sewing machine or the process because I am really familiar with both.
