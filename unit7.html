<h1>Unit 7</h1>
<h2>Lamination and Vacuum Forming</h2>
<br>
<p>
In Unit 7 we made skateboards using Lamination and Vacuum Forming so the normal scaket board can get its curvy shape.

<h3>Lamination and Vacuum Forming</h3>
	
<p>
Although I did not make a regular skateboard but instead a long board I faced separate challenges in forming my board 
because I did not use Vacuum Forming but pressure from two pieces of wood.
First lets start at the beginning, I made my board from thin pieces of wood which I quickly glued together with wood glue and 
then placed my board between pieces of wood and with 4 clamps kept the board together.
Then I let the glue dry for more than 24 hours. I got my board after it dried and when taking off the wood pushing the thin pieces of wood together my board cracked.
I had to fix the cracks and also fix the parts of my board which was not connected causing me to wait another 24 hours before I could clean up my board.
After fixing my board with sanding and cutting down rough ends I started my staining process. 
I stained my board with Black stainer and while the stain was drying I created a sticker for my board.
Once my board was dry I added my sticker which said never settle and then applied a clear protective coat to hold everything together.
